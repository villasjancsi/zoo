# Zoo
Have you ever wanted an own Zoo?!

### Description
Have you ever wanted an own Zoo? With this game you can play on a map,
which supports 12 animal containers. If you lead the zoo well, more
people will come. You can put animals only in the specified containers.
You have to pay after all your animals every hour (hourly cost). You
have to hire employees for care about animals. If you don't, animals
will die. There are levels for animals, and for employees. Don't forget
to match these values, because a level2 employee can't care about a
level3 animal. Every employee can care about 5 animals per hour. 
Employees also have salary, that you have to pay every hour.
